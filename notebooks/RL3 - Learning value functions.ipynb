    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic challenges in RL:**  \n",
    "- function approximation,\n",
    "- the improvement problem,\n",
    "- the exploration versus exploitation trade-off.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "These three challenges are quite independent and we could study them in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, **function approximation** is key in finding good policies. Although function approximation does not intrinsically require stochastic gradient descent, the interplay between Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning has triggered major advances in RL. \n",
    "Chapter 4 is dedicated to this topic and will lead us to manipulate function approximators in AVI, including deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas we developped in this class relied on estimating value functions to deduce greedy policies. Finding such greedy policies was made easy because actions were discrete. But **finding improving policies** is actually a challenge in itself. This problem is present both when one searches for a greedy action with respect to $Q$, and when one directly aims at solving the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem without going through the proxy of the optimality equation. Chapter 5 will take us towards the realm of continuous actions in AVI. Chapter 6 will tackle direct policy search and resolution of the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem, notably through policy gradient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior policies are a cornerstone of RL: which action should one take to obtain informative samples? Should one explore uniformly the environment or rather follow a policy that takes the system towards promising states before exploring more agressively? This is called the **tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**. Chapters 7 and 8 will be dedicated to properly studying this tradeoff through the theory of stochastic bandits, which leads to the UCT and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms that are at the root of [alphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) and the subsequent alphaZero algorithms.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The result of this gradient step is an approximation of $T^\\pi Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in class that despite the (bounded) error $\\epsilon$ made by an approximation operator $\\mathcal{A}$, the sequence $Q_{n+1} = \\mathcal{A} T^* Q_n$ still converged to a neighborhood of $Q^*$. The same result holds for the sequence $Q_{n+1} = \\mathcal{A} T^\\pi Q_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One single step of stochastic gradient descent makes for a poor approximator. Given a fixed function $Q_n$, if we repeat a certain number $C$ of such gradient steps, we can hope to obtain a better estimate of $T^\\pi Q_n$. So there is an interest in keeping two $Q$ functions in memory. The first is the current estimator, which plays the role of $Q_n$, upon which we apply $T^\\pi$, and which we call the *target* function, sometimes noted $Q^-$ (especially in deep Q-learning). The second is the one we actually optimize and which aims at approximating $T^\\pi Q^-$; we write it $Q$. Every $C$ gradient steps, as $Q$ is hopefully getting close to $T^\\pi Q^-$, we replace $Q^-$ by $Q$ and repeat.\n",

Then, as it transitions from $s'$ to $s''$ and observes $r'$ it can perform the $1$-step TD update in $s'$, but also the $2$-step TD update in $s$! An so on for future transitions. So, incrementally, as time unrolls, the agent will include the $n$-step updates in the $\\lambda$-return of $s$ as they become available. In the limit, when $t\\rightarrow\\infty$, the $\\lambda$-return in every state will be complete and the agent will have completed a $\\lambda$-return algorithm.
