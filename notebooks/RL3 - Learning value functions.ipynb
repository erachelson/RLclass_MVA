    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic challenges in RL:**  \n",
    "- function approximation,\n",
    "- the improvement problem,\n",
    "- the exploration versus exploitation trade-off.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "These three challenges are quite independent and we could study them in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, **function approximation** is key in finding good policies. Although function approximation does not intrinsically require stochastic gradient descent, the interplay between Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning has triggered major advances in RL. \n",
    "Chapter 4 is dedicated to this topic and will lead us to manipulate function approximators in AVI, including deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas we developped in this class relied on estimating value functions to deduce greedy policies. Finding such greedy policies was made easy because actions were discrete. But **finding improving policies** is actually a challenge in itself. This problem is present both when one searches for a greedy action with respect to $Q$, and when one directly aims at solving the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem without going through the proxy of the optimality equation. Chapter 5 will take us towards the realm of continuous actions in AVI. Chapter 6 will tackle direct policy search and resolution of the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem, notably through policy gradient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior policies are a cornerstone of RL: which action should one take to obtain informative samples? Should one explore uniformly the environment or rather follow a policy that takes the system towards promising states before exploring more agressively? This is called the **tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**. Chapters 7 and 8 will be dedicated to properly studying this tradeoff through the theory of stochastic bandits, which leads to the UCT and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms that are at the root of [alphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) and the subsequent alphaZero algorithms.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Often, $S$ is not finite (or is just too large to be enumerated). Consequently, $\\mathbb{R}^S$ has infinite (or just too large) dimension. Thus, tabular representations of $V$ are not possible and one needs to turn to function representations $V_\\theta$ or $Q_\\theta$ with parameters $\\theta$. In this section, we provide a very short discussion on approximation methods for $V$ and $Q$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We wish to approximate $V(s)$ as a linear combination of features $\\varphi(s)=\\left(\\varphi_i(s)\\right)_{i\\in[1,K]}$. This way, $V$ lives in the $K$-dimensional function space $span(\\varphi)$. We have plenty of families of functions that we can rely on and the user's expertise plays a big role in choosing a proper **functional basis**. Generally speaking, we would expect the following properties from a good basis:\n",
    "- the target $V^\\pi$ can be closely approximated by its projection on $\\varphi$\n",
    "- given an initial $V_0 \\in span(\\varphi)$ and the recurrence relation $V_{n+1} = \\Pi_\\varphi (T^\\pi V_n)$ (where $\\Pi_\\varphi$ is the projection operator on $span(\\varphi)$), $V_n$ should be a \"close enough\" approximation of $T^\\pi V_n$. This property is illustrated by the figure below with $Q$ instead of $V$ - excerpt from **[Least-Squares Policy Iteration](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v4/lagoudakis03a.html)** by M. G. Lagoudakis and R. Parr (2003).\n",

    "SARSA is an on-policy method and we've seen that so is TD($\\lambda$) so it seems rather straightforward to implement a SARSA($\\lambda$) algorithm that, hopefully, will have better convergence properties than plain SARSA.\n",

    "This time it is not as straightfoward to derive a $Q(\\lambda)$ algorithm from TD($\\lambda$), precisely because TD($\\lambda$) evaluates the policy being applied and not another one. Can you imagine a way to still perform $Q(\\lambda)$ updates? An answer is found in Watkins's thesis that introduces Q-learning in 1989. For a more recent approach and other references, see Sutton et al, <b>A new Q($\\lambda$) with interim forward view and Monte Carlo equivalence</b>, 2014)\n",
