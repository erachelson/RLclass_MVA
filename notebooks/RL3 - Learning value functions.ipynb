    "But this is the XXIst century: most algorithms don't work in tabular form, data is abundant, neural networks (and other function approximators) are everywhere. So I made the deliberate choice **not** to write a class about TD-learning and Q-learning, but rather to discuss how one can implement approximate dynamic programming as a sequence of risk minimization problems, in its full generality. TD-learning and Q-learning are important landmarks in RL history. They help grasping intuitions and concepts. But they are also special cases of risk minimization applied to the dynamic programming sequence of functions arising from Bellman equations. So my belief is that a **modern** class on RL should not present them as independent algorithms but should rather fully set the stage they belong to, and only then do them historical justice by presenting them as the important milestones they are.

    "These three challenges are quite independent and we could study them in any order.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ideas we developped in this class relied on estimating value functions to deduce greedy policies. Finding such greedy policies was made easy because actions were discrete. But **finding improving policies** is actually a challenge in itself. This problem is present both when one searches for a greedy action with respect to $Q$, and when one directly aims at solving the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem without going through the proxy of the optimality equation. Chapter 5 will take us towards the realm of continuous actions in AVI. Chapter 6 will tackle direct policy search and resolution of the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem, notably through policy gradient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior policies are a cornerstone of RL: which action should one take to obtain informative samples? Should one explore uniformly the environment or rather follow a policy that takes the system towards promising states before exploring more agressively? This is called the **tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**. Chapters 7 and 8 will be dedicated to properly studying this tradeoff through the theory of stochastic bandits, which leads to the UCT and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms that are at the root of [alphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) and the subsequent alphaZero algorithms.  \n",
