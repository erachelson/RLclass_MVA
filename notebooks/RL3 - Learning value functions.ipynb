    "Extending the ideas developped in the previous section is quite straightforward when we remember that value iteration is actually the alternance of applying a *greediness operator* on a Q-function to define $\\pi$, then applying $T^\\pi$ to $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recall a few definitions of the previous chapter:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greediness operator**  \n",
    "For deterministic policies:\n",
    "$$\\pi \\in \\mathcal{G} Q, \\Leftrightarrow \\pi(s) \\in \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} Q(s,a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be extended to stochastic policies:\n",
    "$$\\pi \\in \\mathcal{G} Q, \\Leftrightarrow \\pi(s) \\in \\arg\\max_{\\pi \\in \\Delta_A} \\mathbb{E}_{a\\sim\\pi} \\left[Q(s,a)\\right]$$\n",

    "$$\\pi_n \\in \\mathcal{G} Q_n, \\quad Q_{n+1} = T^{\\pi_n} Q_n.$$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, $Q^*$ is the limit reached by this sequence of $Q_n$ functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we use an approximation procedure $\\mathcal{A}$ which minimizes the empirical risk when learning $T^{\\pi_n} Q_n$, we are learning $Q_{n+1}$. Then we can define $\\pi_{n+1} \\in \\mathcal{G} Q_{n+1}$ and repeat the learning procedure with $T^{\\pi_{n+1}} Q_{n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference with what we wrote for the evaluation equation is that the policy being evaluated at each step of the sequence now changes, as it is defined as greedy with respect to the last learned value function.\n",

The homework will guide you to implement it with random forests and future classes will implement it with neural networks (yielding the famous **[Deep Q-networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236)** algorithm). The point of this section is really to cast the resolution of the Bellman equation as the very generic problem of a sequence of supervised learning problems. So we repeat what was already written in the previous section:\n",

    "## Approximate Value Iteration as Stochastic Approximation: Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will adapt the reasoning we had earlier with TD learning: we will implement the approximate value iteration algorithm above using stochastic approximation as an approximation procedure, in discrete state and action space MDPs, and with deterministic policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we use deterministic policies, then we don't even need to write $\\pi_n$ anymore: we can directly replace any mention of $\\pi_n(s)$ with an $\\arg\\max_a Q_n(s,a)$, and any mention of $Q_n(s,\\pi_n(s))$ by $\\max_a Q_n(s,a)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we directly adapt the idea of temporal difference learning to the approximate value iteration case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want to learn $T^* Q_t$ (instead of $T^\\pi Q_t$) so our samples are:\n",
    "$$g_t = r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q_t(s_{t+1},a').$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the learning algorithm becomes the famous **Q-learning** algorithm, introduced by C. J. Watkins in his [PhD thesis](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/~chrisw/new_thesis.pdf) in 1989:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\"><b>Q-learning</b><br>\n",
    "For a sample $(s,a,r,s')$, the temporal difference is:\n",
    "$$\\delta = r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)$$\n",
    "And the TD update is:\n",
    "$$Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha \\left[ r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a) \\right]$$\n",
    "As long as all state-action pairs $(s,a)$ are sampled infinitely often as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$, and under the Robbins-Monro conditions, this procedure converges to $Q^*$.\n",

    "To implement a Q-learning algorithm, one needs to decide on a behavior policy. As for TD(0), Q-learning will converge to $Q^*$, provided that all states and actions are visited infinitely often. It is actually notable that $Q$ converges to $Q^*$ even if the behavior policy does not. But it also looks like a waste of computational resources to keep exploring uniformly around the starting state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tradeoff between exploring new actions and exploiting what has already been inferred in $Q$ is called the **exploration versus exploitation tradeoff**. It is a crucial problem that strongly affects the ability of the algorithm to discover new, interesting rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will implement a rather naive tradeoff strategy called an **$\\epsilon$-greedy** behavior. It consists in picking the $Q$-greedy action with probability $1-\\epsilon$ and a random action with probability $\\epsilon$.\n",

    "## Three intrinsic challenges in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can identify three challenges which make the RL problem intrinsically difficult:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic challenges in RL:**  \n",
    "- function approximation,\n",
    "- the improvement problem,\n",
    "- the exploration versus exploitation trade-off.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "These three challenges are quite independent and we could study them in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, **function approximation** is key in finding good policies. Although function approximation does not intrinsically require stochastic gradient descent, the interplay between Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning has triggered major advances in RL. \n",
    "Chapter 4 is dedicated to this topic and will lead us to manipulate function approximators in AVI, including deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas we developped in this class relied on estimating value functions to deduce greedy policies. Finding such greedy policies was made easy because actions were discrete. But **finding improving policies** is actually a challenge in itself. This problem is present both when one searches for a greedy action with respect to $Q$, and when one directly aims at solving the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem without going through the proxy of the optimality equation. Chapter 5 will take us towards the realm of continuous actions in AVI. Chapter 6 will tackle direct policy search and resolution of the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem, notably through policy gradient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior policies are a cornerstone of RL: which action should one take to obtain informative samples? Should one explore uniformly the environment or rather follow a policy that takes the system towards promising states before exploring more agressively? This is called the **tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**. Chapters 7 and 8 will be dedicated to properly studying this tradeoff through the theory of stochastic bandits, which leads to the UCT and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms that are at the root of [alphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) and the subsequent alphaZero algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Subtopics in RL\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these three intrinsic challenges, there are countless, context-dependent, open questions in RL, that form a span of specific questions:\n",
    "- Hierarchical RL\n",
    "- RL from human feedback\n",
    "- World (surrogate) models\n",

    "- Offline RL\n",
