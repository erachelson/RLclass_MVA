    "\n",
    "One very interesting feature of policy gradient methods, compared to dynamic programming ones, is that they take a somewhat more pragmatic  and easier approach at policy improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradients make the policy better by reinforcing good actions in visited states, and discouraging actions that led to bad outcomes. In CartPole, this means that exiting the screen on either side will be penalized as much as falling. This happens quite early in the optimization process: as soon as the policy balances the pole, it starts to drift towards the sides of the screen, gets this negative reward, and hence reinforces actions that keep the cart within the screen (the fact that we draw several trajectories for each policy helps a lot for that matter since it enables comparing different actions and reinforcing the ones which belonged to better trajectories).\n",
    "\n",
    "Converserly, maybe you remember DQN did a great job at quickly learning how to balance the pole, but wasn't so great at avoiding drifting to the edges of the screen. The key difference is that DQN stored all past experience and that exiting from the side ended up being a rather rare situation within the replay buffer. Also, DQN needed to propagate these bad rewards through the value function (a task greatly enhanced by methods like prioritized experience replay), which is done immediately in REINFORCE because $G_t$ is a Monte Carlo estimator, not a TD(0) one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So maybe, with ADP methods, we had set up a task that was excessively difficult. The ADP approach is elegant and sample efficient (it retains a long-term memory of samples and solves for the optimal $Q$ value for *all* state and action pairs. But maybe this was more than what was necessary: a local search among policy parameters, without retaining a memory of past experience, but instead local comparison of trajectories and reinforcement of good ones, might be sufficient to achieve efficient learning."

When we instantiate such environments, we generally set a time limit, but this does not constitute a termination condition, rather a trajectory truncation one. In particular, a Monte Carlo estimate of $Q^\\pi(s,a)$ based on a truncated trajectory might be very biased if $s,a$ is encountered at a time step close to the time limit.\n",

Although this might seem sample inefficient, it can turn out to be an acceptable compromise if the policy gradient steps take the policy towards good returns quickly enough.\n",
