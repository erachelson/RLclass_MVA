    "The policy gradient theorem tells us that in order to improve the value of $\\pi_\\theta$, we should change $\\theta$ in a direction that is a linear combination of all $\\nabla_\\theta \\pi(a|s)$, giving more weight to actions that provide a large $Q^\\pi(s,a)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can push the interpretation of $\\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi(a|s) = \\frac{\\nabla_\\theta \\pi(a|s)}{\\pi(a|s)}$ a bit further. $\\nabla_\\theta \\pi(a_t|s_t)$ is a vector in parameter space that points in the direction of greatest increase of $\\pi(a|s)$. The update will encourage taking a step in this direction if the action provided high return (through $Q(s,a)$), but moving in this direction will be moderated if the action is already picked frequently (through $\\pi(a|s)$) so that other actions have a chance also."

    "So, to compute the gradient, we can run the policy within the environment, and this will provide us with states distributed according to $\\rho^\\pi$ and actions distributed according to $\\pi$. The full trajectory of states-actions-rewards provides a Monte Carlo estimate $G_t$ of $Q^\\pi(s_t,a_t)$ from any state $s_t$ traversed by the trajectory. In turn, this allows to estimate $Q^\\pi(s_t,a_t) \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi(a_t|s_t)$ for any of these states. The sum over all states provides the gradient estimate.\n",

    "This algorithm, introduced by [Williams (1992)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992696) is called REINFORCE. It requires a finite-length trajectory and its pseudo-code goes as follows.\n",

    "Modern deep learning libraries don't take gradients as inputs. Instead, they use automated differentiation to compute them for a given expression, given a batch of samples. So we would like to build a objective function such that its gradient estimated on the minibatch composed of the last trajectory's samples $(s,a)$ corresponds to the expression above.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we want to define $\\ell(\\theta)$ such that $-\\nabla_\\theta \\mathbb{E}_{\\substack{s\\sim\\rho^\\pi \\\\ a\\sim \\pi}} \\left[ \\ell(\\theta,s,a) \\right]$ coincides with $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$. Very simply, taking $\\ell(\\theta) = Q(s,a)\\cdot \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi(a|s)$ achieves this goal as long as $Q(s,a)$ is an unbiased estimate of $Q^\\pi(s,a)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Super important remark**  \n",
    "In supervised learning, it is a common practice to monitor the empirical risk along training. \n",
    "But $L(\\theta) = -\\mathbb{E}_{\\substack{s\\sim\\rho^\\pi \\\\ a\\sim \\pi}} \\left[ \\ell(\\theta,s,a) \\right]$ is not comparable to the losses one usually encounters in supervised learning in any way!  \n",
    "In particular, $-L(\\theta) \\neq J(\\theta)$. So it makes absolutely no sense monitoring the value of this artificial \"loss\" function along training, and even less interpreting its value as some performance metric. It is *just* an expression whose gradient coincides with the (opposite of the) policy gradient."
