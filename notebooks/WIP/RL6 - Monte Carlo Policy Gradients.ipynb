    "\n",
    "One very interesting feature of policy gradient methods, compared to dynamic programming ones, is that they take a somewhat more pragmatic  and easier approach at policy improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradients make the policy better by reinforcing good actions in visited states, and discouraging actions that led to bad outcomes. In CartPole, this means that exiting the screen on either side will be penalized as much as falling. This happens quite early in the optimization process: as soon as the policy balances the pole, it starts to drift towards the sides of the screen, gets this negative reward, and hence reinforces actions that keep the cart within the screen (the fact that we draw several trajectories for each policy helps a lot for that matter since it enables comparing different actions and reinforcing the ones which belonged to better trajectories).\n",
    "\n",
    "Converserly, maybe you remember DQN did a great job at quickly learning how to balance the pole, but wasn't so great at avoiding drifting to the edges of the screen. The key difference is that DQN stored all past experience and that exiting from the side ended up being a rather rare situation within the replay buffer. Also, DQN needed to propagate these bad rewards through the value function (a task greatly enhanced by methods like prioritized experience replay), which is done immediately in REINFORCE because $G_t$ is a Monte Carlo estimator, not a TD(0) one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So maybe, with ADP methods, we had set up a task that was excessively difficult. The ADP approach is elegant and sample efficient (it retains a long-term memory of samples and solves for the optimal $Q$ value for *all* state and action pairs. But maybe this was more than what was necessary: a local search among policy parameters, without retaining a memory of past experience, but instead local comparison of trajectories and reinforcement of good ones, might be sufficient to achieve efficient learning."

When we instantiate such environments, we generally set a time limit, but this does not constitute a termination condition, rather a trajectory truncation one. In particular, a Monte Carlo estimate of $Q^\\pi(s,a)$ based on a truncated trajectory might be very biased if $s,a$ is encountered at a time step close to the time limit.\n",

    "## A2C: Deep Advantage Actor-Critic\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Mnih et al. introduced a set of algorithms using asynchronous environments in the **[Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783)** paper. Among these methods, one is called A3C for Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic. \n",
    "In a nutshell, A3C is an advantage actor-critic method where multiple policy workers in parallel environments independently update a global value function. One supposed key benefit of having asynchronous actors was to promote exploration of the state space. It later turned out, the full asynchronicity of independent policies did not bring a significant performance advantage while inducing some computational overhead. A2C is A3C's little sibling, using a single (hence synchronous) policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each policy update step, A2C runs a number of rollouts with $\\pi_\\theta$, collecting samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses bootstrapped Monte Carlo returns to estimate the advantage in each state-action pair:\n",
    "$$A(s_t,a_t;w) = \\sum_{t'=t}^{T-1} \\gamma^{t'-t} r_{t'} + \\gamma^{T-t} V_w(s_{T}) - V_w(s_t),$$\n",
    "where $T$ is the termination time of a rollout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function learning takes a gradient step to minimize:\n",
    "$$L(w) = \\sum_t A(s_t,a_t;w)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy learning step takes a gradient step to maximize:\n",
    "$$L(\\theta)=\\sum_t \\left[ A(s_t,a_t;w) \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) + \\beta \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{H}(\\pi_\\theta(s_t) \\right].$$\n",
    "The first term in this sum is the usual policy gradient. The second one is the entropy of the policy. The intention is to promote exploration by retaining randomness in the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in short, A2C's pseudo code is:\n",
    "1. Collect trajectories $\\{s_t,a_t,r_t,s'_t\\}$ from $\\pi$\n",
    "2. Define $A(s_t,a_t;w) = \\sum_{t'=t}^{T-1} \\gamma^{t'-t} r_{t'} + \\gamma^{T-t} V_w(s_{t+T}) - V_w(s_t)$\n",

    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we have considered the problem of direct policy search. We have:\n",
    "- cast this problem as a gradient ascent one,\n",
    "- introduced the policy gradient theorem,\n",
    "- derived its direct application as the REINFORCE algorithm,\n",
    "- tackled the problem of gradient variance through the introduction of baselines.\n",
    "- Since baselines required estimating a value function, we have written actor-critic algorithms,\n",
    "- and in particular we have introduced the recent A2C algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are still lots of things to cover in the literature on policy gradients and more generally policy search. The homework will guide you through some of these important topics, which should provide you with an up-to-date view on the current state-of-the-art in direct policy search."

    "\n",
    "One key feature of policy gradient algorithms is that they are on-policy: they require the data to have been collected by the current policy, and discard this data once a gradient step is taken. Although this might seem sample inefficient, it can turn out to be an acceptable compromise if the policy gradient steps take the policy towards good returns quickly enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "A direct consequence of this on-policy property, is that policy gradients don't use experience replay buffers. Instead, they can take advantage of parallel computation to collect samples.
