    "Eventually, we have a fully offline procedure that seems to achieve an efficient control for the cart-pole (or acrobot) environment. This is a rather strong result: with fully offline samples we seem to be able to learn good controlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are limits to this approach, mostly due to the mismatch between $\\rho$ and the states and actions actually visited by the learned policy $\\pi$.  \n",
    "What would have happened if, in acrobot, there had been no sample with `done=True` in the training set?  \n",
    "Isn't the totally random collection of samples a waste of computational resources in some states, and a lack of exploration in others?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some samples in the training set might be very redundant or completely unrelated to states encountered by $\\pi$. Their presence in the training set biases the loss. Additionally, collecting them did cost us some computing time, which might have been better used.  \n",
    "Conversely, some states and actions visited by $\\pi$ might be absent from the support of $\\rho$. Because of this, there are no good estimates of $Q(s,a)$ obtained from the training set, which prevent actually incrementally improving $\\pi$.  \n",
    "We discussed this in the previous chapter when we covered the importance of the behavior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple empirical fix to this problem would be to enrich the training set incrementally, by performing rounds of data collection at every iteration of FQI, collecting samples from $(s,a)$ pairs seen by $\\pi_n$ and also exploring new actions is the corresponding states $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't implement this now and turn to a more online procedure. However, note that offline RL received a lot of attention and analysis in recent years and is still a very active field of research."

    "## Target networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back. In the end, we have done something quite similar to Q-learning: at every iteration of AVI, the $Q_{n+1} = \\mathcal{A}T^* Q_n$ we compute is obtained by taking a single gradient step in the direction of $T^* Q_n$. This enabled having a single network in memory, and using it to bootstrap its own training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single gradient step makes for a poor function approximator. In turn, the sequence of $Q_n$ functions might be quite unstable and noisy, in particular with environments that have large variance in $s'$ and $r$ (which is not the case for the cart-pole environment). This can be greatly improved by taking several gradient steps on a given loss function $L_n$, instead of taking a single step and changing the loss function after each sample. This idea is the same as that of delayed updates that we introduced in the chapter on temporal difference learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of having a single network, we wish to keep $Q_n$ in memory so that we can refine our approximation $Q_{n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is achieved by the introduction of a *target network* whose parameters are noted $\\theta^-$, and who plays the role of $Q_n$ when learning $Q_{n+1}$. \n",
    "Surprisingly and despite its straightforward roots in AVI, this idea was not implemented in the 2013 **[Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)** paper which introduced DQN. One had to wait for the 2015 **[Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning)** paper to see the introduction of target networks. So the loss of DQN with a target network is:\n",
    "$$L(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{s,a,r,s'} \\left[ \\left( r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a',\\theta^-) - Q(s,a;\\theta) \\right) ^2 \\right],$$\n",
    "and the target network parameters $\\theta^-$ are only updated with the Q-network parameters $\\theta_n$ every $C$ steps and are held fixed between individual updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that more recent approaches smooth out this accumulation process by defining an exponential moving average update at every time step, of the form:\n",
    "$$\\theta^- \\leftarrow \\tau \\theta + (1-\\tau) \\theta^-.$$"

    "No, this is not the same thing. At all.\n",
    "By synchronizing gradient steps, we make sure the replay buffer always tracks the behavior distribution of the current policy. That is: the replay buffer features samples that correspond to trying greedy or exploratory actions in states which are likely to be encountered, and hence, it contains crucial information for policy improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, by using target networks, we don't break this synchronization. We retain it as we update $\\theta$. We simply allow $Q_\\theta$ to better fit $T^* Q_n$ before we move on to the next iteration of AVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, taking several gradient steps on $L_n$ without collecting new data implies taking the risk that the behavior policy's state distribution drifts away from the replay buffer's empirical distribution. In turn, this leads to the risk that gradient updates after the first one are ill-informed. In very easy environments (eg. when state space coverage is rather easy to achieve, like in cart-pole), this can be benign and go unnoticed. But beware: in many difficult situations (eg. when the environment is difficult to explore, when stochasticity is high, when state distributions change quickly with parameter updates, etc.) this can quickly lead to policies that make no sense and eventually perform really badly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting analysis of this dependency can be found in the **[The Difficulty of Passive Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nPHA8fGicZk)** paper by Ostrovski et al. (2021).\n",

    "\n",
    "It might seem trivial, but the question of which optimizer to choose is quite open in RL. Most common choices are RMSprop or Adam (with, sometimes, carefully chosen hyperparameters). For the example of CartPole, it seems Adam with default parameters works better, but that's not a general rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common pratice to stabilize learning is to clip the value of the loss' gradient between $-1$ and $1$. This is not such an uncommon trick, it actually amounts to using an L2 loss for values of the loss between $-1$ and $1$ and an L1 loss outside of this domain. This is also know as the [Huber Loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss) or the [smooth L1 loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#smoothl1loss)."
