    "Consequently, to a constant multiplicative factor, the value of a trajectory under a $\\gamma$-discounted criterion, is actually the value of playing the same game under a total reward criterion, but with a probability of termination of $1-\\gamma$ at each time step. In other words, using the $\\gamma$-discounted criterion boils down to taking into account a probability $\\gamma$ of \"staying alive\" at each time step in the current game."
