This class is joint work between Emmanuel Rachelson (first 6 sessions) and Emilie Kaufmann (2 last ones). Syllabus \ud83d\udd17 This class aims at providing a comprehensive and modern introduction to reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms. It is structured around several chapters, each covered in a separate notebook. Chapter 0: Reinforcement Learning class introduction; key intuitions Chapter 1: Modeling sequential decision problems with Markov Decision Processes Chapter 2: Characterizing value functions: the Bellman equations Chapter 3: Learning value functions Chapter 4: Deep Q-Networks Chapter 5: Continuous actions in DQN algorithms Chapter 6: Direct policy search and policy gradient methods TBC: chapters on bandits, exploration, MCTS and alphaGo Class material \ud83d\udd17 Notebooks for the first 6 chapters are accessible at https://github.com/erachelson/RLclass_MVA . Please download the latest version before class. Schedule for 2023-24 \ud83d\udd17 The schedule is designed around 3-hours sessions. It might be adjusted depending on the progression of classes. Session 1 should cover chapters 0 to 2. Session 2: chapter 3. Session 3: chapter 4. Session 4: chapter 5. Session 5: chapter 6. Session 6 is kept unassigned for now, to preserve the possibility to use it as a buffer to avoid rushing through previous sessions. Session 7 and 8: stochastic bandits, monte carlo tree search and alphaGo. Homework \ud83d\udd17 Each notebook contains homework that help play with the concepts introduced in class, to better grasp them. Most exercises come with solutions. The homework also introduces additional important notions. They are a full and important part to reach the class goals. Often, the provided answer reaches out further than the plain question asked and provides comments, additional insights, or external references. Evaluation \ud83d\udd17 The final grade will be composed of three parts (coefficients TBD). 1. Between session 2 and session 6 (included), a short mandatory online 10-15 minutes quiz will be run at the beginning of class, on the contents of the previous session. These quizes will be graded and will count towards the final grade. 2. An implementation project around session 6 will also be graded. 3. An independant assignment on the last two sessions will finally be graded.","title":"RL class home"},{"location":"index.html#rl-class-mva","text":"Welcome to the website of the reinforcement learning class for the MVA master program .
